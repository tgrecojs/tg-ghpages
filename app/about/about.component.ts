To kick start the semester, I enrolled in a discounted web developer's certification course on Udemy.com. If nothing else, the certification would show that I had dedicated hours towards attaining new knowlegde durng the semester. That being said, I quickly knew that I had tapped into subject matter that I found incredibly interesting. Better yet, I knew that I had found something I was good at! After assessing my past success in graphic design and social media, I wondered why it took so long for me to find programming!`;

        When I am not logging hours on the computer I like to spend time doing all sorts of fun things! I was born and raised in Scranton, PA. Scranton is a unique place. It's filled with large families, so, I, along with my four older siblings, had no shortage of friends growing up. Many of the same people who I ran around (and sometimes terrorized) my neighborhood with are still among my closest friends today and this is something that I believe to be extremely special.
